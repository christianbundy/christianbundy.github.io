title: Hello World

I woke up late this morning, had some green tea, worked a bit, had lunch with Kathleen, had a handful of meetings, and now I'm writing out a to-do list of things I need to finish before going over to Kathleen's for dinner. I've been procrastinating fixing my bike for the past two months (!) and I finally said "fuck it" and threw some brakes on it. There may or may not be a spoke nipple broken off inside the rim, but from what I can tell that shouldn't *actually* matter. I guess we'll see though, right? On the off chance that this is my last will and testament, please donate all of my organs and dispose of my body as inexpensively as possible. I'm half-joking, in that I'm completely joking about dying on a bike ride, but completely serious about the other stuff.

I went to the gym to do my [Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Starting_Strength_Wiki) routine, and did my squats (3x5x145lb), overhead press (3x5x100lb), and deadlifts (1x5x145lb), and skipped cleaning my apartment so that I could get to Kathleen's on time. Unfortunately, I still got there late. Apparently biking around is hard when you have no idea where you're going, and I *really* didn't think the whole "3 mile bike ride after squats and deadlifts" thing through.

I got to her house around 20:30, had a bagel, did my stretches ([Starting Stretching](http://phraktured.net/starting-stretching.html)), and passed out hard around 22:00.

I felt bad that I didn't clean my apartment, but I was happy to actually be getting the rest of my responsibilities finished.
