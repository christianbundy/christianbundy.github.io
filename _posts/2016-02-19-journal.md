I woke up this morning around 05:30 and by 06:00 I was out the door, getting ready to bike home. Unfortunately, somebody else made the decision that they needed the lights on my bike more than I do, so I'll be without a bike light for at least a few days. Not super great, but worse things have happened to better people.

My plans for the day:

- Getting another bike light
- Drinking about eight more gallons of coffee
- [Molding Mobility](http://phraktured.net/molding-mobility.html)
- Going climbing for ~45 minutes
- [Starting Stretching](http://phraktured.net/starting-stretching.html)
- Work for 
- Getting groceries
- Chugging ~2000 kcal of Soylent
- Figuring out what to make for dinner
- Actually making dinner
- Making plans for the weekend
  - Deadpool?
  - Winery?
  - I've still never been to Ground Kontrol
  - Massage on Sunday? 
  - I want to get feedback from Sam on whether or not this journal is an awful idea
