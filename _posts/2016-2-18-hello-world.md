title: Hello World

I woke up late this morning, had some green tea, worked a bit, had lunch with Kathleen, had a handful of meetings, and now I'm writing out a to-do list of things I need to finish before going over to Kathleen's for dinner. I've been procrastinating fixing my bike for the past two months (!) and I finally said "fuck it" and threw some brakes on it. There may or may not be a spoke nipple broken off inside the rim, but from what I can tell that shouldn't *actually* matter. I guess we'll see though, right? On the off chance that this is my last will and testament, please donate all of my organs and dispose of my body as inexpensively as possible. I'm half-joking, in that I'm completely joking about dying on a bike ride, but completely serious about the other stuff.

Here's my to-do list for the night:
- clean my apartment
- hit the gym (Molding Mobility and Starting Strength: 145lb squat, 100lb bench, 145lb deadlift)
- look up how to bike to Kathleen's (I haven't ridden a bike since I lived in Davis and it's pretty dark and rainy right now)
- actually get there
- mow
- bike back
- Starting Stretching
- sleep, preferably at a reasonable time (~18:00)

I'll report back later (tonight/tomorrow) with my progress (or lack thereof).
